Objects are in <strong data-effect="bold">motion</strong> everywhere we look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. Even when you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. And in inanimate objects, there is continuous motion in the vibrations of atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of themselves: <em data-effect="italics">How long will it take for a space probe to get to Mars? Where will a football land if it is thrown at a certain angle?</em> But an understanding of motion is also key to understanding other concepts in physics. An understanding of acceleration, for example, is crucial to the understanding of forces.
</p><p id="eip-922">Our study of physics now turns to <span data-type="term">kinematics</span> which is defined as <em data-effect="italics">the study of motion without considering its causes</em>. The word &#8220;kinematics&#8221; comes from a Greek term meaning motion and is related to other English words such as &#8220;cinema&#8221; (movies) and &#8220;kinesiology&#8221; (the study of human motion). In one-dimensional kinematics and <strong data-effect="bold">Two-Dimensional Kinematics</strong> we will study only the <em data-effect="italics">motion</em> of a football, for example, without worrying about what forces cause or change its motion. Such considerations come in other chapters. In this chapter, we will study only the simplest type of motion&#8212;namely, motion along a straight line, or one-dimensional motion. </p><p id="eip-272">Motion is not as simple to define as you might at first think. You can only know that something is moving or how fast and in what direction it is moving against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving at a known speed and direction. This is what is meant by &#8220;frame of reference&#8221;, a system of at least two objects about which we may know something about one or both of them. </p><figure id="Figure_05_01_02"><figcaption>Are clouds a useful frame of reference to airplane passengers?

</figure><p id="eip-699">For example you and your classroom could be a frame of reference, sometimes called an &#8220;inertial frame&#8221;, or &#8220;<span data-type="term">inertial frame of reference</span>&#8221;. This is because you can tell that you are moving in the classroom because the walls of the classroom are not moving; your motion is measured against the stationary background of the walls of the room. You can also tell that other things are moving in the classroom such as your classmates or the teacher or a ball thrown across the room.</p><p id="eip-587">To continue this example, you can also tell what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say &#8220;I am moving towards the front of the room&#8221;; or &#8220;she moving across the room towards the door.&#8221; Not only does your frame of reference allow you to determine motion but the direction of motion as well. </p>

Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them. <strong data-effect="bold">Distance traveled</strong> is <em data-effect="italics">the total length of the path traveled between two positions</em>. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance the student walks is 2.0 m. The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 m.
</p>
<p id="eip-447">Take a look at <a href="#Figure_05_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. It is important to note that the <em data-effect="italics">distance traveled</em>, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit). For example, the student could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 m, yet still end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case her displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement would be 2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 m. In kinematics we nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of displacement, and almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of the motion. The displacement is simply the difference in the position of the two marks and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks. The distance traveled, however, is the total length of the path taken between the two marks.</p><figure id="Figure_05_01_05"><figcaption>Although the displacement is from the red arrow at the door to the side of the house by the tree, the distance is considerably more!

So, a <strong data-effect="bold">scalar</strong> quantity is fully described simply by stating a number, a magnitude. Whenever you are talking about displacement you are using a vector quantity. So, a <strong data-effect="bold">vector</strong> quantity is fully described by stating a number, magnitude, as well as a direction. Direction can be described using a phrase like &#8220;towards the door&#8221; or by defining a frame of reference so that positive and negative directions are opposite each other.
</p><p id="eip-969">The same is true for describing the rate of motion. When all you need is &#8216;how fast&#8217; something is going you can use the scalar of &#8216;how fast&#8217; which is speed. But when you need both &#8216;how fast&#8217; and &#8216;in what direction&#8217; you would use the vector, which is velocity.

</tbody></table><p id="eip-257">Arrows with tips and tails are used to represent vectors. An arrow used to represent a vector has a length proportional to the vector&#8217;s magnitude; the larger the magnitude, the longer the length of the vector, and the tip points in the same direction as the vector. Some physical quantities, like distance, either have no direction or none is specified. A scalar is any quantity that has a magnitude, but no direction. For example, a 20&#186;C temperature, the 250 kilocalories (250 Calories) of energy in a candy bar, a 90 km/h speed limit, a person&#8217;s 1.8 m height, and a distance of 2.0 m are all scalars&#8212;quantities with no specified direction. Note, however, that a scalar can be negative, such as a &#8722;20&#186;C temperature. In this case, the minus sign indicates a point on a scale rather than a direction. Since scalar quantities have no direction, they are never represented by arrows.</p><p id="eip-143">In any inertial frame of reference to describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must designate a coordinate system within the frame of reference. For one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting of a one-dimensional coordinate line. In general, when describing horizontal motion, motion to the right is usually considered positive, and motion to the left is considered negative. </p><p id="eip-15">With vertical motion, motion up is usually positive and motion down is negative. In some cases, however, as with the jet in <a href="#Figure_05_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, it can be more convenient to switch the positive and negative directions. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be useful to define downwards as the positive direction. If people in a race are running to the left, it is useful to define left as the positive direction. It does not matter as long as the system is clear and consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving a problem, you cannot change it.</p><figure id="Figure_05_01_07"><figcaption>In a frame of reference that has both horizontal and vertical possibilities the horizontal is specified with an &#8216;<em data-effect="italics">x</em>&#8217; subscript and the vertical with a &#8216;<em data-effect="italics">y</em>&#8217; subscript. By convention up and to the right is positive while down and to the left is negative.

</div>

<div data-type="solution" id="eip-156">
  <p id="eip-932">
  1.Since velocity is a vector the displacement of the brick must be calculated as 6.0 m + (-3.0 m) giving you 3.0 m to the right. When this is divided by 12 s you get 0.25 m/s to the right. Be sure the student&#8217;s answers include the direction! To calculate the speed the distance is divided by the time so the 6.0 m and the 3.0 m are simply added without regard to the direction. 9.0 m divided by 12 s gives 0.75 m/s without regard to direction.

  You may have heard of Einstein&#8217;s Theories of relativity already. But did you notice the plural in that first sentence? That is because Einstein actually had two theories of relativity. The first was published in 1905 and it came to be called &#8220;The Special Theory of Relativity&#8221;; the second was published ten years later and it is called &#8220;The General Theory of Relativity&#8221;. Of course, as you might expect, the second theory incorporates the first. Now that you know that Einstein&#8217;s first theory is called the &#8220;special&#8221; theory you have to ask &#8220;What makes it special?&#8221; The answer to this question is the focus of this part of chapter 5. 
  </p><p id="eip-id4210096">Let&#8217;s first discuss the term &#8216;relativity&#8217;. This idea is really nothing new. We have already discussed motion as a relative concept. Do you recall in the first part of this chapter you read that you know something moves because something else does not move? In other words, motion is relative. When you walk across your classroom your motion is relative to the stationary building or the stationary Earth. </p><p id="eip-id2012850">What would happen if the classroom moved even as you moved? This might be like walking down a down escalator, you are moving as the escalator is moving and someone else watching you from the floor would say that you were moving at a speed that is the sum of your speed and the speed of the escalator. So, still, motion is relative. </p><p id="eip-id3157014">But, what if you were to walk up the down escalator at exactly the same speed as the down escalator was moving down. Then a person standing on the floor would say that you were not moving at all. And again, motion is relative.</p><p id="eip-id3855967">Now, suppose you were in a ship going north at 8 m/s and you were walking south at only 6 m/s. Even though you are facing south you would actually be going north at 2 m/s wouldn&#8217;t you? However, if you were in the middle of the ocean you might have a difficult time knowing that you were actually going north. Why? You would have a difficult time knowing you were actually going north because there would be nothing stationary to you to tell you that you were going north. All your information, that is the walls of the ship, would tell you that you were traveling south. Since the only frame of reference you have is the ship you would have to conclude that you were going south.</p><figure id="Figure_05_01_08"><figcaption>You could be walking 1.7 m/s south on the deck of a ship that is going 10 m/s north. Which way would you actually be going and how fast would you be going in that direction?</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="eip-id2004894" data-alt=" "><img src="/resources/9595fc3b95432a898ea823769e56521b/Figure_05_01_08.jpg" data-media-type="image/jpeg" alt=" "/></span>

</figure><p id="eip-id1396469">As you can see for these examples knowing that you are moving and in what direction can be quite difficult in certain conditions. All motion is relative and all motion must be determined by a frame of reference against which motion and direction can be determined, even if the conclusions are not &#8216;right&#8217; from another frame of reference.</p><p id="eip-id3658244">Both Galileo and Newton understood this idea very well. Galileo pointed out that one could only tell something was moving if something else, the background, was not. But what about Earth and the sun? How can you know for sure whether the sun is rising over a stationary Earth or if the Earth is rotating into a stationary sun? Citing other evidence such as the equinoxes and the motions of Mercury and Venus and the phases of Venus, Galileo got himself into quite a bit of trouble with the astronomers of his time when he determined that it was the moving Earth turning towards a stationary sun. </p></section>

<div data-type="solution" id="eip-34">
  <p id="eip-160">
In terms of motion relativity means two things. First, it means that the motion of an object can only be determined &#8216;relative&#8217; to something else that is not moving. Second, it means that if two objects are in motion each can correctly measure its motion relative to the other moving object.
