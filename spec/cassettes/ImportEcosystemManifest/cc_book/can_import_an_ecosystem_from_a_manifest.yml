        multi-semester biology courses for science majors. It is grounded on an evolutionary
        basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological
        sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. To meet the needs
        of today&#8217;s instructors and students, some content has been strategically
        condensed while maintaining the overall scope and coverage of traditional
        texts for this course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to
        the approach that works best in their classroom. Biology also includes an
        innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions
        to help students understand&#8212;and apply&#8212;key concepts.</div>", "revised":

        id=\"fs-id2299671\">What is biology? In simple terms, <span data-type=\"term\">biology</span>
        is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and
        their environments. This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology
        is vast. Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic
        view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_01\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). Listening to the daily news,
        you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology are discussed every day.
        For example, recent news topics include <em data-effect=\"italics\">Escherichia
        coli</em> (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>)
        outbreaks in spinach and <em data-effect=\"italics\">Salmonella</em> contamination
        in peanut butter. Other subjects include efforts toward finding a cure for
        AIDS, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and cancer. On a global scale, many researchers
        are committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues,
        and reduce the effects of climate change. All of these diverse endeavors are
        related to different facets of the discipline of biology.</p><figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_02\"><figcaption><em

        id=\"fs-id2739621\">Biology is a science, but what exactly is science? What
        does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines? <span data-type=\"term\">Science</span>
        (from the Latin <em data-effect=\"italics\">scientia</em>, meaning &#8220;knowledge&#8221;)
        can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of
        general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method.
        It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific
        method plays a major role in science. The <span data-type=\"term\">scientific
        method</span> is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments
        and careful observation.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1787324\">The steps of the scientific
        method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects
        of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments.
        A <span data-type=\"term\">hypothesis</span> is a suggested explanation for
        an event, which can be tested. Although using the scientific method is inherent
        to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because
        it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as
        physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like archaeology,
        psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as
        it becomes more difficult to repeat experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2186987\">These
        areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archeology&#8212;even
        though one cannot perform repeatable experiments, hypotheses may still be
        supported. For instance, an archeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture
        existed based on finding a piece of pottery. Further hypotheses could be made
        about various characteristics of this culture, and these hypotheses may be
        found to be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from
        other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified theory. A <span data-type=\"term\">theory</span>
        is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Science
        may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature
        of the universe.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1876646\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Natural
        Sciences</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1626542\">What would you expect to see in a museum
        of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how
        the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or, maybe all of the
        above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer
        sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_03\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). However, those fields of science
        related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered
        <span data-type=\"term\">natural sciences</span>. Thus, a museum of natural
        sciences might contain any of the items listed above.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_03\"><figcaption>The

        is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences
        include, however. For some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology,
        chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural
        sciences into <span data-type=\"term\">life sciences</span>, which study living
        things and include biology, and <span data-type=\"term\">physical sciences</span>,
        which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and
        chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both
        life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Natural sciences are
        sometimes referred to as &#8220;hard science&#8221; because they rely on the
        use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior
        are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive investigations and
        findings.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1780952\">Not surprisingly, the natural science
        of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell
        structure and function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the
        structure of an entire organism. Those biologists studying physiology, however,
        focus on the internal functioning of an organism. Some areas of biology focus
        on only particular types of living things. For example, botanists explore
        plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.</p>\n</section>\n<section
        data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1470518\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Scientific Reasoning</h2>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1422041\">One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate
        goal &#8220;to know.&#8221; Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for
        the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the
        way it operates. To do this, they use two methods of logical thinking: inductive
        reasoning and deductive reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1727981\"><span data-type=\"term\">Inductive
        reasoning</span> is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations
        to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive
        science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records
        them. These data can be qualitative or quantitative, and the raw data can
        be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations,
        the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive
        reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation
        and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies provide an example.
        In this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing
        a specific activity, such as viewing images of food. The part of the brain
        that &#8220;lights up&#8221; during this activity is then predicted to be
        the part controlling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case,
        images of food. The &#8220;lighting up&#8221; of the various areas of the
        brain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active
        areas of the brain. The resultant increase in radioactivity is observed by
        a scanner. Then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if
        similar responses result.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2979121\">Deductive reasoning
        or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive
        reason, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared
        to inductive reasoning. <span data-type=\"term\">Deductive reasoning</span>
        is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast
        specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate
        and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general
        principles are valid. Studies in climate change can illustrate this type of
        reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes
        warmer in a particular region, then the distribution of plants and animals
        should change. These predictions have been made and tested, and many such
        changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture,
        with change based on temperature averages.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1786661\">Both
        types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific
        study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based science. <span data-type=\"term\">Descriptive
        (or discovery) science</span>, which is usually inductive, aims to observe,
        explore, and discover, while <span data-type=\"term\">hypothesis-based science</span>,
        which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and
        a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these
        two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine
        both approaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how
        easily observation can lead to specific questions. For example, a gentleman
        in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his
        dog&#8217;s fur had a tiny hook structure. On closer inspection, he discovered
        that the burrs&#8217; gripping device was more reliable than a zipper. He
        eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener popularly
        known today as Velcro. Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are
        in continuous dialogue.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\"
        id=\"fs-id2318184\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">The Scientific Method</h1>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1870503\">Biologists study the living world by posing questions
        about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach is common to other
        sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific
        method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England&#8217;s
        Sir Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626) (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_04\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>),
        who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method
        is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost all fields
        of study as a logical, rational problem-solving method.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_04\"><figcaption>Sir
        Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626) is credited with being the first to define
        the scientific method. (credit: Paul van Somer)</figcaption><span data-type=\"media\"

        a long robe.\" width=\"200\"/>\n</span>\n\n</figure><p id=\"fs-id1695658\">The
        scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to
        be solved) that leads to a question. Let&#8217;s think about a simple problem
        that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the
        problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers
        that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes
        a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: &#8220;Why
        is the classroom so warm?&#8221;</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1568706\"><h2
        data-type=\"title\">Proposing a Hypothesis</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1812636\">Recall
        that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve
        a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed. For example, one hypothesis
        might be, &#8220;The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.&#8221;
        But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses
        may be proposed. A second hypothesis might be, &#8220;The classroom is warm
        because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn&#8217;t
        work.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1966007\">Once a hypothesis has been selected,
        the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis
        but it typically has the format &#8220;If . . . then . . . .&#8221; For example,
        the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, &#8220;<em data-effect=\"italics\">If</em>
        the student turns on the air conditioning, <em data-effect=\"italics\">then</em>
        the classroom will no longer be too warm.&#8221;</p>\n</section>\n<section
        data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id2186799\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Testing a Hypothesis</h2>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1428118\">A valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also be
        <span data-type=\"term\">falsifiable</span>, meaning that it can be disproven
        by experimental results. Importantly, science does not claim to &#8220;prove&#8221;
        anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification
        with further information. This step&#8212;openness to disproving ideas&#8212;is
        what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. The presence of the supernatural,
        for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a
        researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one
        or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one or more variables
        and one or more controls. A <span data-type=\"term\">variable</span> is any
        part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. The
        <span data-type=\"term\">control group</span> contains every feature of the
        experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized
        about. Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the
        control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation,
        rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the
        examples that follow. To test the first hypothesis, the student would find
        out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but
        does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should
        be rejected. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check if the
        lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and
        this hypothesis should be rejected. Each hypothesis should be tested by carrying
        out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not
        determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates
        one hypothesis that is not valid (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_05\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental
        data are rejected.</p><p id=\"fs-id2000920\">While this &#8220;warm classroom&#8221;
        example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments
        might have clearer controls. For instance, a student might attend class on
        Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. One observation
        to explain this occurrence might be, &#8220;When I eat breakfast before class,
        I am better able to pay attention.&#8221; The student could then design an
        experiment with a control to test this hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1473946\">In
        hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted from a general premise.
        This type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from
        the general to the particular. But the reverse of the process is also possible:
        sometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific
        observations. This type of reasoning is called inductive reasoning, and it
        proceeds from the particular to the general. Inductive and deductive reasoning
        are often used in tandem to advance scientific knowledge (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_06\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\"

        Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach;
        often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle.
        Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists
        continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as
        their research proceeds. Scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific
        method alone suggests. Notice, too, that the scientific method can be applied

        Science: Basic Science and Applied Science</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id1983427\">The
        scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the
        value of different types of science. Is it valuable to pursue science for
        the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have
        worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our
        lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science:
        basic science and applied science.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1980540\"><span data-type=\"term\">Basic
        science</span> or &#8220;pure&#8221; science seeks to expand knowledge regardless
        of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not focused on developing
        a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate
        goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge&#8217;s sake, though this
        does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2164078\">In contrast, <span data-type=\"term\">applied science</span>
        or &#8220;technology,&#8221; aims to use science to solve real-world problems,
        making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for
        a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (<a
        href=\"#fig-ch01_01_07\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). In applied
        science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_07\"><figcaption>After
        Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
        rescued this brown pelican. Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how
        to rehabilitate the bird. (credit: FEMA)</figcaption>\n<span data-type=\"media\"

        a brown pelican with a broken wing wrapped in a red cast.\" width=\"320\"/>\n</span>\n\n</figure>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id3662284\">Some individuals may perceive applied science as &#8220;useful&#8221;
        and basic science as &#8220;useless.&#8221; A question these people might
        pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, &#8220;What
        for?&#8221; A careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that
        basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value.
        Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before
        an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results
        generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to
        move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems.
        Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand
        immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help
        of the wide knowledge foundation generated through basic science.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1803917\">One example of how basic and applied science can work
        together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA structure
        led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication.
        Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they
        provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, DNA makes
        new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding the mechanisms
        of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that
        are now used to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at
        a crime scene, and determine paternity. Without basic science, it is unlikely
        that applied science would exist.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2690084\">Another example
        of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project,
        a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine
        the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location of each gene.
        (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual&#8217;s complete collection
        of genes is his or her genome.) Other less complex organisms have also been
        studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding of
        human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_08\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>)
        relied on basic research carried out with simple organisms and, later, with
        the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the data for
        applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related
        diseases.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_08\"><figcaption>The Human Genome
        Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several
        different fields of science. The project, which sequenced the entire human
        genome, was completed in 2003. (credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome

        research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully
        planned, it is important to note that some discoveries are made by <span data-type=\"term\">serendipity</span>,
        that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Penicillin
        was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri
        dish of <em data-effect=\"italics\">Staphylococcus</em> bacteria open. An
        unwanted mold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out
        to be <em data-effect=\"italics\">Penicillium</em>, and a new antibiotic was
        discovered. Even in the highly organized world of science, luck&#8212;when
        combined with an observant, curious mind&#8212;can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.</p>\n</section>\n<section
        data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1467930\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">Reporting Scientific
        Work</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id3019610\">Whether scientific research is basic science
        or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other
        researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with
        other scientists&#8212;when planning, conducting, and analyzing results&#8212;are
        all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects
        of a scientist&#8217;s work are communicating with peers and disseminating
        results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific
        meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who
        are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed
        manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. <span data-type=\"term\">Peer-reviewed
        manuscripts</span> are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist&#8217;s
        colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts
        in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist&#8217;s
        work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure
        that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original,
        significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for
        research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their
        work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or
        different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must
        be consistent with the findings of other scientists.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2979084\">A
        scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity
        is required to design experiments, there are fixed guidelines when it comes
        to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief,
        concise, and accurate. A scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed
        enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2954730\">The
        scientific paper consists of several specific sections&#8212;introduction,
        materials and methods, results, and discussion. This structure is sometimes
        called the &#8220;IMRaD&#8221; format. There are usually acknowledgment and
        reference sections as well as an <span data-type=\"term\">abstract</span>
        (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional
        sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published;
        for example, some review papers require an outline.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1292278\">The
        <span data-type=\"term\">introduction</span> starts with brief, but broad,
        background information about what is known in the field. A good introduction
        also gives the rationale of the work; it justifies the work carried out and
        also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where the hypothesis or research
        question driving the research will be presented. The introduction refers to
        the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following
        the style of the journal. Using the work or ideas of others without proper
        citation is considered <span data-type=\"term\">plagiarism</span>.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2279649\">The <span data-type=\"term\">materials and methods</span>
        section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used,
        and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data. The
        description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat
        the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose.
        This section will also include information on how measurements were made and
        what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to examine raw
        data. Although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description
        of the experiments, it does not discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1790931\">Some
        journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it
        is more common to combine both. If the journal does not allow the combination
        of both sections, the <span data-type=\"term\">results</span> section simply
        narrates the findings without any further interpretation. The results are
        presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should
        be presented. In the <span data-type=\"term\">discussion</span> section, the
        researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related,
        and attempt to explain the observations. It is indispensable to conduct an
        extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously
        published scientific research. Therefore, proper citations are included in
        this section as well.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2967146\">Finally, the <span data-type=\"term\">conclusion</span>
        section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the
        scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions
        that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions. Therefore,
        a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others
        to continue and expand on the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1318474\"><span
        data-type=\"term\">Review articles</span> do not follow the IMRAD format because
        they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature; instead,
        they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature
        and typically include extensive reference sections.</p>\n</section>\n<section

        Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id2261646\">Biology is the science that studies living
        organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments.
        Science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe in
        whole or in part by rational means. Science has many fields; those fields
        related to the physical world and its phenomena are considered natural sciences.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1836512\">Science can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic
        science is to expand knowledge without any expectation of short-term practical
        application of that knowledge. The primary goal of applied research, however,
        is to solve practical problems.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2909561\">Two types of logical
        reasoning are used in science. Inductive reasoning uses particular results
        to produce general scientific principles. Deductive reasoning is a form of
        logical thinking that predicts results by applying general principles. The
        common thread throughout scientific research is the use of the scientific
        method, a step-based process that consists of making observations, defining
        a problem, posing hypotheses, testing these hypotheses, and drawing one or
        more conclusions. The testing uses proper controls. Scientists present their
        results in peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals.
        A scientific research paper consists of several well-defined sections: introduction,
        materials and methods, results, and, finally, a concluding discussion. Review
        papers summarize the research done in a particular field over a period of
        time.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id2959003\" class=\"art-exercise\"><h1

        the scientific method is used by most of the sciences, it can also be applied
        to everyday situations. Think about a problem that you may have at home, at
        school, or with your car, and apply the scientific method to solve it.</p>\n</div>\n<div

        id=\"fs-id1650865\">Answers will vary, but should apply the steps of the scientific
        method. One possibility could be a car which doesn&#8217;t start. The hypothesis
        could be that the car doesn&#8217;t start because the battery is dead. The
        experiment would be to change the battery or to charge the battery and then
        check whether the car starts or not. If it starts, the problem was due to
        the battery, and the hypothesis is accepted.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-type=\"exercise\"

        including living things. Some of the most abundant elements in living organisms
        include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These
        form the nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids that are the fundamental
        components of living matter. Biologists must understand these important building
        blocks and the unique structures of the atoms that make up molecules, allowing
        for the formation of cells, tissues, organ systems, and entire organisms.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idm10142720\">All biological processes follow the laws of physics
        and chemistry, so in order to understand how biological systems work, it is
        important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry. For example,
        the flow of blood within the circulatory system follows the laws of physics
        that regulate the modes of fluid flow. The breakdown of the large, complex
        molecules of food into smaller molecules&#8212;and the conversion of these
        to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8212;is a
        series of chemical reactions that follow chemical laws. The properties of
        water and the formation of hydrogen bonds are key to understanding living
        processes. Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important, for
        example, to our understanding of the digestive process. Therefore, the fundamentals
        of physics and chemistry are important for gaining insight into biological
        processes.</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>", "subjects": ["Science and Technology"],

        its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. <span data-type=\"term\">Matter</span>
        is any substance that occupies space and has mass. <span data-type=\"term\">Elements</span>
        are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties
        that cannot be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions.
        There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. The remaining elements
        are synthesized in laboratories and are unstable.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338796754528\">Each
        element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter
        or, when the first letter is already &#8220;taken&#8221; by another element,
        a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the
        element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements&#8217; chemical
        symbols derive from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium
        is Na, referring to <em data-effect=\"italics\">natrium</em>, the Latin word
        for sodium.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338796747920\">The four elements common
        to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen
        (N). In the non-living world, elements are found in different proportions,
        and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth
        as a whole, as shown in <a href=\"#tab-ch02_01_01\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>.
        For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little
        carbon and hydrogen, while the earth&#8217;s crust, although it contains oxygen
        and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon. In spite of
        their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between
        them obey the same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they are
        a part of the living or non-living world.</p>\n<table id=\"tab-ch02_01_01\"

        Structure of the Atom</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338798858736\">To understand
        how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or
        building block of an element, the atom. An <span data-type=\"term\">atom</span>
        is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties
        of an element. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold
        in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very
        large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing
        small amounts of other elements known as impurities. Gold atoms cannot be
        broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of

        mass, about 1.67 &#215; 10<sup>-24</sup> grams. Scientists arbitrarily define
        this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown
        in <a href=\"#tab-ch02_01_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>.
        Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge.
        A <span data-type=\"term\">proton</span> is positively charged whereas a <span
        data-type=\"term\">neutron</span> is uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons
        in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. <span
        data-type=\"term\">Electrons</span> are much smaller in mass than protons,
        weighing only 9.11 &#215; 10<sup>-28</sup> grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic
        mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element&#8217;s overall
        atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore
        the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom&#8217;s mass based on the
        number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors
        to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom&#8217;s charge, as each
        electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In
        uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is
        equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive
        and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net
        charge.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338796885040\">Accounting for the sizes of protons,
        neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom&#8212;greater than

        might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another.
        The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively
        charged and negative charges repel each other.</p>\n<table id=\"tab-ch02_01_02\"

        contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons
        determines an element&#8217;s <span data-type=\"term\">atomic number</span>
        and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons
        is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same
        atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the
        number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element&#8217;s
        <span data-type=\"term\">mass number</span>, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_02\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. Note that the small contribution
        of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This
        approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an
        element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number.
        Since an element&#8217;s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers,
        scientists also determine the <span data-type=\"term\">atomic mass</span>,
        which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring
        isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the
        atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several
        isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons)

        gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C)
        is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from
        atmospheric <sup>14</sup>N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the
        loss of a proton because of cosmic rays. This is a continuous process, so
        more <sup>14</sup>C is always being created. As a living organism incorporates
        <sup>14</sup>C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis,
        the relative amount of <sup>14</sup>C in its body is equal to the concentration
        of <sup>14</sup>C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer
        ingesting <sup>14</sup>C, so the ratio between <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C
        will decline as <sup>14</sup>C decays gradually to <sup>14</sup>N by a process
        called beta decay&#8212;the emission of electrons or positrons. This decay
        gives off energy in a slow process.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338807733920\">After
        approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of <sup>14</sup>C
        will have been converted back to <sup>14</sup>N. The time it takes for half
        of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable
        form is called its half-life. Because the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is long,
        it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood. Comparing
        the ratio of the <sup>14</sup>C concentration found in an object to the amount
        of <sup>14</sup>C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that
        has not yet decayed can be determined. On the basis of this amount, the age
        of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_03\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>, can be calculated with accuracy
        if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes
        with different half lives. For example, <sup>40</sup>K (potassium-40) has
        a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and <sup>235</sup>U (Uranium 235) has a
        half-life of about 700 million years. Through the use of radiometric dating,
        scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms

        should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons
        in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one element from another,
        and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the
        number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. Thus, each element,
        at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons
        equal to its atomic number.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338797198608\">An early
        model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885&#8211;1962).
        The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and
        neutrons, with the electrons in circular <span data-type=\"term\">orbitals</span>
        at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_05\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. These orbits form electron shells
        or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in
        the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the
        symbol &#8220;n.&#8221; For example, 1n represents the first energy level
        located closest to the nucleus.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch02_01_05\" class=\"

        model, electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists
        in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus.
        Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but
        this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground

        they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to
        fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are
        multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in
        each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the
        outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its
        tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idp140338797044384\">Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner
        shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost
        shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two
        electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons. This is known
        as the <span data-type=\"term\">octet rule</span>, which states, with the
        exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically

        that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of
        protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among
        the outer shell. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based
        on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located. Take a closer
        look at the some of the elements in the table&#8217;s far right column in
        <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_04\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. The
        group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer
        electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other
        atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms. Their non-reactivity
        has resulted in their being named the <span data-type=\"term\">inert gases</span>
        (or <span data-type=\"term\">noble gases</span>). Compare this to the group
        1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H),
        lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells.
        That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer
        shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule
        such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this
        configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become
        stable. As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively
        charged <span data-type=\"term\">ions</span>. Group 17 elements, including
        fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they
        tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making
        them negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most
        important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing
        them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus,
        the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of
        these elements&#8217; outer electron shells that is responsible for their
        similar chemical characteristics.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\"

        id=\"fs-idp140338796317104\">Although useful to explain the reactivity and
        chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does not
        accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the
        nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but
        are found in <span data-type=\"term\">electron orbitals</span>. These relatively
        complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles,
        but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as
        wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an
        electron might be at any given time. The area where an electron is most likely
        to be found is called its orbital.</p>\n        <p id=\"fs-idp140338796636704\">Recall
        that the Bohr model depicts an atom&#8217;s electron shell configuration.
        Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified
        number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate
        exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably
        located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the letter s,<em
        data-effect=\"italics\"> p</em>,<em data-effect=\"italics\"> d</em>, and<em
        data-effect=\"italics\"> f</em>. The <em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> subshell
        is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single
        <em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> orbital, which can hold two electrons.
        Principal shell 2n has one <em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> and one <em
        data-effect=\"italics\">p</em> subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons.
        The <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em> subshell has three dumbbell-shaped
        orbitals, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_07\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>.
        Subshells <em data-effect=\"italics\">d</em> and <em data-effect=\"italics\">f</em>
        have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively.
        These are not shown in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has <em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em>,
        <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em>, and <em data-effect=\"italics\">d</em>
        subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has <em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em>,
        <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em>, <em data-effect=\"italics\">d</em> and
        <em data-effect=\"italics\">f</em> orbitals and can hold 32 electrons.  Moving
        away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy
        levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table,
        the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into
        the next available orbital.</p><figure id=\"fig-ch02_01_07\" class=\" \"><figcaption>The

        data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> orbital because it is spherical around the
        nucleus. The 1<em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> orbital is the closest orbital
        to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can
        be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within

        hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period); this
        is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1<em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em>
        orbital. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1<em
        data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> and no other electron orbitals in the electrically
        neutral state.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338796531296\">The second electron shell
        may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another spherical <em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em>
        orbital and three &#8220;dumbbell&#8221; shaped <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em>
        orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as shown in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_07\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. After the 1<em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em>
        orbital is filled, the second electron shell is filled, first filling its
        2<em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> orbital and then its three <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em>
        orbitals. When filling the <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em> orbitals, each
        takes a single electron; once each <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em> orbital
        has an electron, a second may be added. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons
        that occupy the first and second shells. Two electrons fill the 1<em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em>

        Neon (Ne), on the other hand, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its

        shell (two each in the 2<em data-effect=\"italics\">s</em> and three <em data-effect=\"italics\">p</em>

        that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms. Larger elements have
        additional orbitals, making up the third electron shell. While the concepts
        of electron shells and orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more
        accurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital

        id=\"fs-idp140338806167168\">Some atoms are more stable when they gain or
        lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost
        electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number
        of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge.
        <span data-type=\"term\">Cations</span> are positive ions that are formed
        by losing electrons. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are
        called anions. <span data-type=\"term\">Anions</span> are designated by their
        elemental name being altered to end in &#8220;-ide&#8221;: the anion of chlorine
        is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idp140338806078224\"> This movement of electrons from one element
        to another is referred to as <span data-type=\"term\">electron transfer</span>.
        As <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_10\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>
        illustrates, sodium (Na)  only has one electron in its outer electron shell.
        It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to
        accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron,
        it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with
        an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl)
        in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in
        its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one
        electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create
        an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative
        (&#8211;1) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example,
        sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will
        accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule
        and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no
        longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium
        cation) or &#8211;1 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions
        can normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to
        lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like
        a chlorine atom.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch02_01_10\" class=\" \"><figcaption>In

        bonds</span>. These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds
        in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are commonly found in
        carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds
        are also found in inorganic molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>,
        and O<sub>2</sub>. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making
        single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between
        two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.</p><p
        id=\"fs-idp140338805937584\">The strength of different levels of covalent
        bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time
        in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though
        molecular nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere.
        Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other
        and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons
        between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron
        shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms.
        This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart
        this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idp140338804795680\">The formation of water molecules provides an
        example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to
        form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in <a
        href=\"#fig-ch02_01_08\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. The electron
        from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the
        hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms. To completely
        fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell
        but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen
        atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons
        are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making
        both elements more stable.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a <span data-type=\"term\">polar
        covalent bond</span>, shown in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_11\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>,
        the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to
        one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons
        between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (<em data-effect=\"italics\">&#948;</em>+)
        or slightly negative (<em data-effect=\"italics\">&#948;</em>&#8211;) charge
        develops. This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts
        for many of its characteristics.</p><p id=\"fs-idp140338804492768\">Water
        is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive
        charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. This occurs because the nucleus
        of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms
        than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen&#8217;s electrons. Thus oxygen
        has a higher <span data-type=\"term\">electronegativity</span> than hydrogen
        and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus
        than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen
        and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. Another
        way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near
        an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus.
        Either way, the atom&#8217;s relative electronegativity contributes to the
        development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more
        electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds
        may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction
        of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail
        below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to
        slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.) Since macromolecules
        often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds
        are often present in organic molecules.</p></section>\n<section data-depth=\"2\"

        form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that
        share electrons equally. For example, molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is
        nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two
        oxygen atoms.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338804490560\">Another example of a nonpolar
        covalent bond is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), also shown in <a href=\"#fig-ch02_01_11\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. Carbon has four electrons in its
        outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four
        hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight
        electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but
        are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron
        for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons.
        These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen
        atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch02_01_11\"

        bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of
        the critical, life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures
        of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.</p><p id=\"fs-idp140338806173648\">When
        polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has
        a slightly positive charge because hydrogen&#8217;s electron is pulled more
        strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the
        hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative
        charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#948;</em><sup>+</sup>of
        the hydrogen from one molecule and the <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#948;</em>&#8211;
        charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen
        or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a <span
        data-type=\"term\">hydrogen bond</span>. This type of bond is common and occurs
        regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and
        easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic
        polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible
        for zipping together the DNA double helix.</p><p id=\"fs-idp140338806175616\">Like
        hydrogen bonds, <span data-type=\"term\">van der Waals interactions</span>
        are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals attractions
        can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations
        of the electron densities, which are not always symmetrical around an atom.
        For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one
        another. These bonds&#8212;along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds&#8212;contribute
        to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary
        for their proper function.</p><div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        Chemist</span>\nPharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development
        of new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and new
        drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process. Drugs
        can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory.
        In many cases, potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the
        laboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic
        versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp140338805878000\">After
        the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the
        drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic,
        and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production. Then, the
        process of getting the drug approved for human use begins. In the United States,
        drug approval is handled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves
        a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the
        drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat.
        This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians
        and scientists, in addition to chemists, to complete testing and gain approval.</p><p
        id=\"fs-idp140338804755008\">An example of a drug that was originally discovered
        in a living organism is Paclitaxel (Taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat
        breast cancer. This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree.
        Another example is aspirin, originally isolated from willow tree bark. Finding
        drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other
        forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within
        them. Sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where
        an active compound can be found. For example, the use of willow bark to make
        medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt.
        It was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known
        as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified and marketed for human use.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idp140338806211664\">Occasionally, drugs developed for one use are
        found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to be used in other,
        unrelated ways. For example, the drug minoxidil (Rogaine) was originally developed
        to treat high blood pressure. When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals
        taking the drug would grow new hair. Eventually the drug was marketed to men
        and women with baldness to restore lost hair.</p>\n        <p id=\"fs-idp140338804755392\">The
        career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation,
        and drug development, all with the goal of making human beings healthier.</p>\n</div>\n</section></section>\n<section

        Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-idp140338803666464\">Matter is anything that occupies
        space and has mass. It is made up of elements. All of the 92 elements that
        occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various
        ways to create molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, tissues, organ
        systems, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons,
        are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of
        that element. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities
        between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds,
        as well as van der Waals interactions.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\"

        your eyes and picture a brick wall. What is the basic building block of that
        wall? A single brick, of course. Like a brick wall, your body is composed
        of basic building blocks, and the building blocks of your body are cells.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id806351\">Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for
        a specific purpose. Just as a home is made from a variety of building materials,
        the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial
        cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities
        within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Cells of the immune
        system fight invading bacteria. Additionally, blood and blood cells carry
        nutrients and oxygen throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide. Each
        of these cell types plays a vital role during the growth, development, and
        day-to-day maintenance of the body. In spite of their enormous variety, however,
        cells from all organisms&#8212;even ones as diverse as bacteria, onion, and
        human&#8212;share certain fundamental characteristics.</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>",

        unit of a living thing. A living thing, whether made of one cell (like bacteria)
        or many cells (like a human), is called an organism. Thus, cells are the basic
        building blocks of all organisms.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1754058\">Several cells
        of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function
        form tissues, several tissues combine to form an organ (your stomach, heart,
        or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive
        system, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems that function
        together form an organism (like a human being). Here, we will examine the
        structure and function of cells.</p><p id=\"fs-id1325976\">There are many
        types of cells, all grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic
        and eukaryotic. For example, both animal and plant cells are classified as
        eukaryotic cells, whereas bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before
        discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic,
        let&#8217;s first examine how biologists study cells.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"1\"
        id=\"fs-id1448007\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">Microscopy</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id2075340\">Cells
        vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells cannot be seen with the
        naked eye, so scientists use microscopes (micro- = &#8220;small&#8221;; -scope
        = &#8220;to look at&#8221;) to study them. A <span data-type=\"term\">microscope</span>
        is an instrument that magnifies an object. Most photographs of cells are taken
        with a microscope, and these images can also be called micrographs.</p><p
        id=\"fs-id1723106\">The optics of a microscope&#8217;s lenses change the orientation
        of the image that the user sees. A specimen that is right-side up and facing
        right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when
        viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved
        left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and
        if moved down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because microscopes use
        two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Because of the manner by which light
        travels through the lenses, this system of two lenses produces an inverted
        image (binocular, or dissecting microscopes, work in a similar manner, but
        include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear
        to be upright).</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1220623\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Light
        Microscopes</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id801148\">To give you a sense of cell size,
        a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight
        micrometers (abbreviated as eight &#956;m) in diameter; the head of a pin
        of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter. That means about
        250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.</p><p id=\"fs-id1338921\">Most
        student microscopes are classified as <span data-type=\"term\">light microscopes</span>
        (<a href=\"#fig-ch04-01-01\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a><strong
        data-effect=\"bold\">a</strong>). Visible light passes and is bent through
        the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes
        are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells
        are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless
        they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the
        cells.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id848090\">Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate
        college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two parameters that
        are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification
        is the process of enlarging an object in appearance. Resolving power is the
        ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate:
        the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image.
        When oil immersion lenses are used for the study of small objects, magnification
        is usually increased to 1,000 times. In order to gain a better understanding
        of cellular structure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes.</p>\n<figure
        id=\"fig-ch04-01-01\" class=\"  \"><figcaption>(a) Most light microscopes
        used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times

        detail (<a href=\"#fig-ch04-01-02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>),
        it also provides higher resolving power. The method used to prepare the specimen
        for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. Electrons have
        short wavelengths (shorter than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so living
        cells cannot be viewed with an electron microscope.</p><p id=\"fs-id1773165\">In
        a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across
        a cell&#8217;s surface, creating details of cell surface characteristics.
        In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell
        and provides details of a cell&#8217;s internal structures. As you might imagine,
        electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light
        microscopes.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch04-01-02\" class=\"  \"><figcaption>(a)

        id=\"fs-id1456208\">The microscopes we use today are far more complex than
        those used in the 1600s by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch shopkeeper who
        had great skill in crafting lenses. Despite the limitations of his now-ancient
        lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of protista (a type of single-celled
        organism) and sperm, which he collectively termed &#8220;animalcules.&#8221;</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1283231\">In a 1665 publication called <em data-effect=\"italics\">Micrographia</em>,
        experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term &#8220;cell&#8221; for
        the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens.
        In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances
        in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other
        scientists to see some components inside cells.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2182808\">By
        the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann
        were studying tissues and proposed the <span data-type=\"term\">unified cell
        theory</span>, which states that all living things are composed of one or
        more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing
        cells. Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory.</p>\n<div

        you ever heard of a medical test called a Pap smear (<a href=\"#fig-ch04-01-03\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>)? In this test, a doctor takes
        a small sample of cells from the uterine cervix of a patient and sends it
        to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist stains the cells and examines them
        for any changes that could indicate cervical cancer or a microbial infection.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1194585\">Cytotechnologists (cyto- = &#8220;cell&#8221;) are professionals
        who study cells via microscopic examinations and other laboratory tests. They
        are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and
        which are abnormal. Their focus is not limited to cervical cells; they study
        cellular specimens that come from all organs. When they notice abnormalities,
        they consult a pathologist, who is a medical doctor who can make a clinical
        diagnosis.</p><p id=\"fs-id1348294\">Cytotechnologists play a vital role in
        saving people&#8217;s lives. When abnormalities are discovered early, a patient&#8217;s
        treatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of a successful
        outcome.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch04-01-03\"><figcaption>These uterine cervix

        Electron microscopes are ideal because you can view intricate details, but
        they are bulky and costly, and preparation for the microscopic examination

        and bustle, Grand Central Station functions with a high level of organization:
        People and objects move from one location to another, they cross or are contained
        within certain boundaries, and they provide a constant flow as part of larger
        activity. Analogously, a plasma membrane&#8217;s functions involve movement
        within the cell and across boundaries in the process of intracellular and
        intercellular activities. (credit: modification of work by Randy Le&#8217;Moine)</figcaption><span

        plasma membrane, which is also called the cell membrane, has many functions,
        but the most basic one is to define the borders of the cell and keep the cell
        functional. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable. This means that
        the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell, while
        other materials cannot move freely, but require the use of a specialized structure,
        and occasionally, even energy investment for crossing.</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>",

        still others, all in controlled quantities. The plasma membrane must be very
        flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells,
        to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more
        obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma
        membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which
        is vital for tissue and organ formation during early development, and which
        later plays a role in the &#8220;self&#8221; versus &#8220;non-self&#8221;
        distinction of the immune response.</p><p id=\"fs-id2012431\">Among the most
        sophisticated functions of the plasma membrane is the ability to transmit
        signals by means of complex, integral proteins known as receptors. These proteins
        act both as receivers of extracellular inputs and as activators of intracellular
        processes. These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites
        for effectors like hormones and growth factors, and they activate intracellular
        response cascades when their effectors are bound. Occasionally, receptors
        are hijacked by viruses (HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, is one example)
        that use them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors
        become mutated, causing the process of signal transduction to malfunction
        with disastrous consequences.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id2078559\"><h1
        data-type=\"title\">Fluid Mosaic Model</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id2188439\">The existence
        of the plasma membrane was identified in the 1890s, and its chemical components
        were identified in 1915. The principal components identified at that time
        were lipids and proteins. The first widely accepted model of the plasma membrane&#8217;s
        structure was proposed in 1935 by Hugh Davson and James Danielli; it was based
        on the &#8220;railroad track&#8221; appearance of the plasma membrane in early
        electron micrographs. They theorized that the structure of the plasma membrane
        resembles a sandwich, with protein being analogous to the bread, and lipids
        being analogous to the filling. In the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably
        transmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the
        core of the plasma membrane consisted of a double, rather than a single, layer.
        A new model that better explains both the microscopic observations and the
        function of that plasma membrane was proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L.
        Nicolson in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1511371\">The explanation proposed by
        Singer and Nicolson is called the <span data-type=\"term\">fluid mosaic model</span>.
        The model has evolved somewhat over time, but it still best accounts for the
        structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them.
        The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a
        mosaic of components&#8212;including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins,
        and carbohydrates&#8212;that gives the membrane a fluid character. Plasma
        membranes range from 5 to 10 nm in thickness. For comparison, human red blood
        cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 &#181;m wide, or
        approximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane. The membrane does
        look a bit like a sandwich (<a href=\"#fig-ch05_01_01\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p>\n<figure

        (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates attached to some
        of the lipids and some of the proteins. A phospholipid is a molecule consisting
        of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked head group. Cholesterol,
        another lipid composed of four fused carbon rings, is found alongside the
        phospholipids in the core of the membrane. The proportions of proteins, lipids,
        and carbohydrates in the plasma membrane vary with cell type, but for a typical
        human cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass,
        lipids (of all types) account for about 40 percent of the composition by mass,
        with the remaining 10 percent of the composition by mass being carbohydrates.
        However, the concentration of proteins and lipids varies with different cell
        membranes. For example, myelin, an outgrowth of the membrane of specialized
        cells that insulates the axons of the peripheral nerves, contains only 18
        percent protein and 76 percent lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains
        76 percent protein and only 24 percent lipid. The plasma membrane of human
        red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. Carbohydrates are present only on the

        but generally do not interact with polar molecules. When placed in water,
        hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The hydrophilic regions
        of the phospholipids tend to form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar
        molecules on both the exterior and interior of the cell. Thus, the membrane
        surfaces that face the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic.
        In contrast, the interior of the cell membrane is hydrophobic and will not
        interact with water. Therefore, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer
        cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside

        gives the overall molecule an area described as its head (the phosphate-containing
        group), which has a polar character or negative charge, and an area called
        the tail (the fatty acids), which has no charge. The head can form hydrogen
        bonds, but the tail cannot. A molecule with this arrangement of a positively

        that separates the water and other materials on one side of the barrier from
        the water and other materials on the other side. In fact, phospholipids heated

        with a single layer&#8212;while others stretch from one side of the membrane

        These carbohydrate chains may consist of 2&#8211;60 monosaccharide units and
        can be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates
        form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each
        other. These sites have unique patterns that allow the cell to be recognized,
        much the way that the facial features unique to each person allow him or her
        to be recognized. This recognition function is very important to cells, as
        it allows the immune system to differentiate between body cells (called &#8220;self&#8221;)
        and foreign cells or tissues (called &#8220;non-self&#8221;). Similar types

        The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic and attracts large amounts of water to
        the surface of the cell. This aids in the interaction of the cell with its
        watery environment and in the cell&#8217;s ability to obtain substances dissolved
        in the water. As discussed above, the glycocalyx is also important for cell
        identification, self/non-self determination, and embryonic development, and

        and glycolipid patterns on the surfaces of cells give many viruses an opportunity
        for infection. HIV and hepatitis viruses infect only specific organs or cells
        in the human body. HIV is able to penetrate the plasma membranes of a subtype
        of lymphocytes called T-helper cells, as well as some monocytes and central
        nervous system cells. The hepatitis virus attacks liver cells.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1397237\">These
        viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites
        on their surfaces that are specific to and compatible with certain viruses
        (<a href=\"#fig-ch05_01_05\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Other recognition sites on the virus&#8217;s surface interact with the human
        immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made
        in response to the antigens or proteins associated with invasive pathogens,
        or in response to foreign cells, such as might occur with an organ transplant.
        These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach and either destroy
        or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these recognition sites
        on HIV change at a rapid rate because of mutations, making the production
        of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult, as the virus evolves
        and adapts. A person infected with HIV will quickly develop different populations,
        or variants, of the virus that are distinguished by differences in these recognition
        sites. This rapid change of surface markers decreases the effectiveness of
        the person&#8217;s immune system in attacking the virus, because the antibodies
        will not recognize the new variations of the surface patterns. In the case
        of HIV, the problem is compounded by the fact that the virus specifically
        infects and destroys cells involved in the immune response, further incapacitating
        the host.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch05_01_05\"><figcaption>HIV binds to the

        id=\"fs-id2075565\">The mosaic characteristic of the membrane, described in
        the fluid mosaic model, helps to illustrate its nature. The integral proteins
        and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules.
        These resemble the separate, multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they
        float, moving somewhat with respect to one another. The membrane is not like
        a balloon, however, that can expand and contract; rather, it is fairly rigid
        and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in too much water. However,
        because of its mosaic nature, a very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma
        membrane without causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal
        when the needle is extracted.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1699791\">The mosaic characteristics
        of the membrane explain some but not all of its fluidity. There are two other
        factors that help maintain this fluid characteristic. One factor is the nature
        of the phospholipids themselves. In their saturated form, the fatty acids
        in phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. There are no
        double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. This results in tails that are
        relatively straight. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a
        maximal number of hydrogen atoms, but they do contain some double bonds between
        adjacent carbon atoms; a double bond results in a bend in the string of carbons
        of approximately 30 degrees (<a href=\"#fig-ch05_01_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2270965\">Thus, if saturated fatty acids, with their straight tails,
        are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each other, making
        a dense and fairly rigid membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed,
        the &#8220;kinks&#8221; in their tails elbow adjacent phospholipid molecules
        away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This &#8220;elbow
        room&#8221; helps to maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at
        which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids would
        &#8220;freeze&#8221; or solidify. The relative fluidity of the membrane is
        particularly important in a cold environment. A cold environment tends to
        compress membranes composed largely of saturated fatty acids, making them
        less fluid and more susceptible to rupturing. Many organisms (fish are one
        example) are capable of adapting to cold environments by changing the proportion
        of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to the lowering
        of the temperature.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id1853625\"

        membrane constituent that assists in maintaining fluidity. Cholesterol, which
        lies alongside the phospholipids in the membrane, tends to dampen the effects
        of temperature on the membrane. Thus, this lipid functions as a buffer, preventing
        lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing increased temperatures
        from increasing fluidity too much. Thus, cholesterol extends, in both directions,

        variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cell&#8217;s
        recognition sites are of prime interest in immunology. These changes are taken
        into consideration in vaccine development. Many infectious diseases, such
        as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of
        vaccines.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1870873\">Immunologists are the physicians and
        scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies
        or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems
        (diseases in which a person&#8217;s immune system attacks his or her own cells
        or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such
        as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) or hereditary (such as severe
        combined immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat
        organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed
        so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some immunologists
        work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person&#8217;s environment
        on it. Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases
        such as cancer. In the past, the importance of having a healthy immune system
        in preventing cancer was not at all understood.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2072586\">To
        work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required. In addition, immunologists
        undertake at least 2&#8211;3 years of training in an accredited program and
        must pass an examination given by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology.
        Immunologists must possess knowledge of the functions of the human body as
        they relate to issues beyond immunization, and knowledge of pharmacology and
        medical technology, such as medications, therapies, test materials, and surgical
        procedures.</p>\n</div></section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id2199901\"
        class=\"summary\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">Section Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id1806528\">The
        modern understanding of the plasma membrane is referred to as the fluid mosaic
        model. The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with
        their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape
        of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane.
        Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell.
        Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing
        surface of the membrane, forming complexes that function to identify the cell
        to other cells. The fluid nature of the membrane is due to temperature, the
        configuration of the fatty acid tails (some kinked by double bonds), the presence
        of cholesterol embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic nature of the proteins
        and protein-carbohydrate combinations, which are not firmly fixed in place.
        Plasma membranes enclose and define the borders of cells, but rather than
        being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.</p>\n</section><section
